## 요구사항

- NVIDIA CUDA driver 지원이 가능한 GPU
- Anaconda 환경
- `transformers>=4.41.0`  (EXAONE 3.0 Model). 
- [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 환경 (웹 환경을 위함)

### secret

`secret/key.txt` 에 huggingface 토큰을 넣어주세요. 토큰은 레파지토리의 읽기 권한이 있어야만 합니다.


## Quickstart

```bash
 streamlit run app.py --server.fileWatcherType none
```

## Limitation

The EXAONE language model has certain limitations and may occasionally generate inappropriate responses. The language model generates responses based on the output probability of tokens, and it is determined during learning from training data. While we have made every effort to exclude personal, harmful, and biased information from the training data, some problematic content may still be included, potentially leading to undesirable responses. Please note that the text generated by EXAONE language model does not reflects the views of LG AI Research.

- Inappropriate answers may be generated, which contain personal, harmful or other inappropriate information.
- Biased responses may be generated, which are associated with age, gender, race, and so on.
- The generated responses rely heavily on statistics from the training data, which can result in the generation of
semantically or syntactically incorrect sentences.
- Since the model does not reflect the latest information, the responses may be false or contradictory.

LG AI Research strives to reduce potential risks that may arise from EXAONE language model. Users are not allowed
to engage in any malicious activities (e.g., keying in illegal information) that may induce the creation of inappropriate
outputs violating LG AI’s ethical principles when using EXAONE language model.
